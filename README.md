# counterJS - Chuka Okoye-Ahaneku
## My Approach
* Simple web app to create a counter in Javascript. Uses DOM elements to retrieve the functions, and convert them into actions to modify the h1 heading of the number.
* Made with the assistance of a coach to help myself understand how the DOM elements are linked with Javascript. Buttons used to increase, decrease and reset the count.
